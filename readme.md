This is currently a very basic implementation of a Graph DB in Python.  It is very early and may change significantly.  Check it out and file issues with your feedback!

- Requires Python 3.4
- Designed to be general purpose, but especially for use as the storage in the Adhara Entity Component System, a core part of the Adhara Engine, the game engine that will power the MMO game Adhara.
- Each Node or Edge is identified by a UUID
- Nodes and Edges can have an unlimited number of Attributes
- Only Supports undirected graphs at this time
- No fancy Graph Traversal algorithms (yet- contributions welcome, see below :)

#Road Map#
- Pluggable storage engines
- Implementations of basic graph algorithms
- More, better unit tests

#Contributing#
- All code is Apache 2 licensed
- Currently this library is in its infancy.  Please open an issue before you begin work on any contributions so that we can properly plan together and save a ton of potentially wasted time :)

#Usage#
I really should write some documentation here :)
